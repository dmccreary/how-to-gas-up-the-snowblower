## About This MicroSim

This MicroSim helps learners calculate how much two-cycle oil to add for a given amount of gas and a chosen gas-to-oil ratio. It provides instant feedback in fluid ounces, milliliters, and tablespoons so measurements are easy in the shop or garage.

## How to Use

1. Set the **Gas (gal)** slider to match the amount of gas in your container.
2. Set the **Ratio (gas:oil)** slider to match the engine requirement (default is 50:1).
3. Read the **Oil needed** values in the display panel and measure that amount of oil.

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School) and adult learners

### Duration
10-15 minutes

### Prerequisites
- Understand simple ratios (for example, 50:1)
- Familiarity with measuring fluids in ounces or milliliters

### Activities

1. **Exploration** (5 min): Adjust the gas amount from 0.25 to 5 gallons and observe how oil needs change.
2. **Guided Practice** (5 min): Set ratio to 50:1 and calculate oil for 1.25 gallons (a common gas can size).
3. **Assessment** (5 min): Change the ratio to 40:1 and compute the oil needed for 2.5 gallons.

### Assessment
Students can correctly compute oil amounts for three different gas volumes and ratios.
